Extractive systems were the first type of CEMS developed for continuous emissions monitoring. Two types of extractive systems 

1. fully extractive, source-level systems
2. dilution systems. 

There are three types of source-level extractive systems:

* hot/wet system. it uses a heated line to transport the flue gas to an analyzer that incorporates a sample cell heated above the flue gas temperature. The gas delivered to the analyzer are both hot and wet. The particulate matter needs to be removed with a course filters located at the probe.  

* cool/dry systems with conditioning at the probe. 
* cool/dry systems with conditioning at the CEMS shelter

Gas is conditioned before it enters the analyzer. The gas temperature is reduced to ambient temperature temperature and moisture is removed.
