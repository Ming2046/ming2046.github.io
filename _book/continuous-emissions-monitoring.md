## History

The first continuous emission monitoring requirements in the US were promulgated for fossil fuel-fired steam generators in December 1971. 
In 1974, Germany passed the Federal Immission Control Law that included requirements for continuous emission monitoring. 
However, the CEM industry did not begin to develop until after October 6, 1975, when the US EPA established performance specification for CEMS and required their installation in a limited number of sources.
